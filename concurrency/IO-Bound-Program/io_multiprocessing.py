  # It does this by creating a new instance of the Python interpreter to run on each CPU and then farming out part of your program to run on it
  
  # Bringing up a separate Python interpreter is not as fast as starting a new thread in the current Python interpreter
  #  Itâ€™s a heavyweight operation and comes with some restrictions and difficulties, but for the correct problem, it can make a huge difference
